# Diabetes-Risk-Analysis
The Predictive Pathway: Diabetes Risk Analysis is a comprehensive project designed to develop machine learning algorithms that classify individuals as diabetic, pre-diabetic, or non-diabetic using clinical and demographic data. The dataset, sourced from Medical City Hospital and the Specialized Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes in Iraq, comprises 100,000 records with features such as age, gender, laboratory values (including HbA1c, cholesterol, and triglycerides), and other clinical measurements. Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to ensure data quality, including encoding categorical variables, handling outliers with IQR methods, and verifying statistical distributions through tests like Shapiro-Wilk and t-tests.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using histograms and correlation heatmaps to reveal key patterns in BMI, HbA1c, and age distributions. A multiple logistic regression model was then constructed using critical predictors such as HbA1c, Age, and BMI, achieving an overall prediction accuracy of 92.93%. The modelâ€™s performance was validated using confusion matrices and other statistical metrics, confirming the significance of the selected features in predicting diabetes. This project underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to facilitate early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and more informed clinical decision-making.
